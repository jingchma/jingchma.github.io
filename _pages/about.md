Jingchen is a master student of control systems at the ECE Department, University of Michigan. She is looking for a Ph.D. position. Her research is currently focused on battery thermal management and battery modeling, but she also has a broad interest in battery state estimation and diagnosticsï¼Œ optimization and constrain-based control algorithms in various application scenario and control and modeling of energy systems.

She currently works on the benefits of thermal preconditioning in various application scenarios supervised by [Prof. Anna Stefanopoulou](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~annastef/) in the [Battery control group](https://batterycontrolgroup.engin.umich.edu/home).

She has strong background in control theory and battery modeling and state estimation knowledge. She did some hands-on work on battery related model construction, battery state estimation and UAV control. She also has experience in typical machine learning algorithms.

She has good programing skill of Matlab/Simulink, C, Python, and statistical analysis software Stata.
