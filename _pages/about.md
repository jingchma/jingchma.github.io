Jingchen is a master student of control systems at the ECE Department, University of Michigan. She is looking for a Ph.D. position. Her research is currently focused on battery thermal management and battery modeling, but she also has a broad interest in battery state estimation and diagnostics, battery-related economic and environmental assessment, optimization control algorithms and modeling of various energy systems.

She currently works on the aging impact and environmental benefits of thermal preconditioning in winter condition supervised by [Prof. Anna Stefanopoulou](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~annastef/) in the [Battery Control Group](https://batterycontrolgroup.engin.umich.edu/home).

She has strong background in control theory and battery modeling and state estimation knowledge. She did some hands-on work on battery management system, GHG emissions calculation and UAV control. She also has experience in typical machine learning algorithms.

She has good programing skill of Matlab/Simulink, C, Python, and statistical analysis software Stata.
