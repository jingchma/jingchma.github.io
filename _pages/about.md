Jingchen is a master student of control systems at the ECE Department, University of Michigan. She is looking for a Ph.D. position. Her research is currently focused on battery thermal management and battery modeling, but she has a broad interest in optimization and constrain-based control algorithms in various application scenario, battery state estimation and diagnostics and control and modeling of energy systems.

She currently works on the benefits of thermal preconditioning in various application scenarios supervised by Prof. Anna Stefanopoulou in the Battery control group.

She has strong background in control theory and battery modeling knowledge. She did some hands-on work on battery related model construction, battery state estimation and UAV control. She also has experience in typical machine learning algorithms.

She has good programing skill of Matlab/Simulink, C, Python, and statistical analysis software Stata.
